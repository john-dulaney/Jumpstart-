    <p>During my junior summer in High scool I worked as a Produce Clerk in the famed 'The Fresh Market' in Brentwood as a full time employee. My job consisted of duties ranging from stocking the produce shelves and removing unfavorable looking products
      to constructing pre cut shish kabob packs for sale. Other duties included copious amounts of cutting of fruits and vegetables for numerous packages we offered, crisping all leaf produce at night, and on-the-go customer service with a smile.</p>
    <!--I made 6 dollars an hour and hated it-->

    <p>In September of 2007, while in High School at Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington Missouri, I enlisted in the Army. That Summer I completed Infantry One Station Unit Training in Ft. Benning, GA, with the intent of returning to Wentwrth for ROTC.
      I stayed 3 more years at Wentworth in the Junior college, drilling once a month with the Missouri National Guard and completing ROTC duties during the week. </p>
    <p>Upon my commission as a 2nd Lieutenant in May of 2010, I was assigned to be a Platoon Leader of the 36 men in 2nd platoon of Charlie company 1/138th Infantry Regiment. My duties included 24/7 personnel accountability, training of men to ensure their
      lethality in combat, and being the sole signee of $485,000 worth of Army equipment at the age of 21. </p>

    <p>Not long after my commission, September 6th 2010 to be precise, I was in a car wreck that left me paralyzed from the mid chest down. All of my Army duties ceased, and I was honorably discharged nearly 2 years later.</p>

    <p>After my spinal cord injury in 2010, I spent several years trying to get back into the rhythm of life. Most of this was through trying to go back to school. I initially tried to attend the University of Missouri within a year of my injury but being
      so far from home and going through the very serious realities of life in a wheelchair eventually I saw myself coming back to middle Tennessee after just 1 year there. Throughout recent years I have taken a few courses at MTSU geared towards a computer
      information systems major, but couldn't ever get into it enough to finish.</p>

    <p> I've had some hard times with serious medical issues keeping me home during years that should be my prime. I'm currently enrolled in a nice little web development starter course that looks promising for the future.</p>
